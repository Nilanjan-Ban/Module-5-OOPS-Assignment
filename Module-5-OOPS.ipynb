(repr(obj)).\n","__len__()\tReturns the length of an object (len(obj)).\n","__getitem__()\tAllows indexing (obj[index]).\n","__setitem__()\tAllows setting values (obj[index] = value).\n","__call__()\tMakes an object callable like a function.\n","__eq__()\tDefines equality comparison (==).\n","__lt__()\tDefines less than comparison (<).\n","__add__()\tDefines addition (+

Modularity (Encapsulation)\n","Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.\n","This ensures that the internal workings of an object are hidden from the outside world, and only the necessary interfaces (methods)\n","are exposed to interact with the object.\n","Advantage: It helps in creating modular systems, making it easier to develop, maintain, and understand code.\n","\n","2. Reusability (Inheritance)\n","Inheritance allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class. This enables code reuse, reduces redundancy, and makes it easier to maintain and extend the code.\n","Advantage: With inheritance, you can build on top of existing code and extend or modify functionality without changing the original code.\n","\n","3. Flexibility and Extensibility (Polymorphism)\n","Polymorphism allows the same method or function to behave differently based on the object calling it. This makes it easier to extend the system and modify the behavior of methods without changing the code that uses them.\n","Advantage: You can write more flexible and extensible code that works with objects of different classes in a uniform way.\n","\n","4. Maintainability\n","OOP promotes modularization, which makes it easier to update, debug, and maintain. Each class can be updated independently without affecting other parts of the system.\n","Advantage: Changes to a specific part of the system (a class) can be made without disturbing the rest of the system, promoting easy debugging and maintenance.\n","\n","5. Abstraction\n","Abstraction allows you to focus on high-level functionalities while hiding unnecessary implementation details. You can define abstract methods in a base class and leave the actual implementation to the subclasses.\n","Advantage: It simplifies the interaction with complex systems by exposing only the essential features.\n","\n","6. Data Security (Encapsulation and Information Hiding)\n","Encapsulation allows you to control access to the internal state of an object, ensuring that data can only be modified through defined methods, thus improving security.\n","Advantage: It helps to prevent accidental changes or unauthorized access to sensitive data within an object.\n","\n","7. Improved Collaboration\n","OOP encourages team collaboration by breaking down software into distinct, self-contained modules (objects/classes). Teams can work on different classes independently, which improves productivity and reduces the complexity of managing large projects.\n","Advantage: It simplifies working in teams by promoting clear boundaries and responsibilities between different components of the system.\n","\n","8. Easier Troubleshooting and Debugging\n","Due to the modular structure of OOP, identifying and fixing bugs becomes easier because errors are often localized within a specific class or method.

How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","\n","Ans:  Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism enables you to use a method in different classes that have the same name, but each class can have its own implementation of the method.\n","\n","In the context of inheritance, polymorphism means that a subclass can override a method defined in its parent class. When you call that method on an object of the subclass, Python uses the overridden version of the method rather than the version from the parent class.\n","\n","How Polymorphism Works with Inheritance in Python\n","Method Overriding:\n","\n","In polymorphism, the subclass overrides the method of the superclass.\n","Even if you call the method on an object of the superclass type, the subclass's version of the method gets executed.\n","Dynamic Method Dispatch:\n","\n","Python uses dynamic dispatch (or late binding), meaning that the method that gets executed is determined at runtime, not compile-time.\n","The appropriate method for the actual object type (not the reference type) is called.\n","Method Signature Consistency:\n","\n","For polymorphism to work smoothly, the methods in the subclasses and superclass usually share the same signature (i.e., same method name and parameters),\n"," although Python allows different signatures.\n","\n","Example of Polymorphism in Python with Inheritance\n","Let's look at a simple example where polymorphism is used with inheritance.\n","We'll define a base class Animal and two subclasses Dog and Cat. Both subclasses will have an speak() method, but each will have a different implementation.\n","\n","class Animal:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n","\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Dog barks\")\n","\n","class Cat(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Cat meows\")\n","\n","# Polymorphism in action\n","def make_animal_speak(animal):\n","    animal.speak()\n","\n","# Create instances of Dog and Cat\n","dog = Dog()\n","cat = Cat()\n","\n","# Passing the instances to the same function\n","make_animal_speak(dog)  # Output: Dog barks\n","make_animal_speak(cat)  # Output: Cat meows\n","Explanation:\n","We have a base class Animal with a method speak().\n","The subclasses Dog and Cat each override the speak() method to provide their own implementation.\n","In the function make_animal_speak(), we pass instances of Dog and Cat.\n","Even though the function expects an Animal object, Python will call the appropriate speak() method for the actual object type, demonstrating polymorphism.\n","In this case:\n","\n","When we pass a Dog object, it calls the speak() method in the Dog class.\n","When we pass a Cat object, it calls the speak() method in the Cat class.\n","'''"],"metadata":{"id":"fHCAUSMtKI6n"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["'''24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","\n","Ans:  Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple methods are called on the same object, one after the other, in a single line of code.

In other words, when you define the __call__ method in a class, you can use the instance of that class as if it were a function.\n","\n","This enables callable objects, which means instances of a class can be invoked using parentheses (()), just like functions.\n","\n","How the __call__ Method Works\n","When an instance of a class is called, Python looks for the __call__ method and executes it.
